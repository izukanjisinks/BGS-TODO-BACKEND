#The repo contains the backend of the todo app. This repo can be cloned in the htdocs directory of XAMP so path reads "BGS-TODO-BACKEND/backend/*" 
#so that the frontend can correctly access the needed files that provide an entry to the database for login, registration and crud operations.
#example of url path needed by the frontend; "http://localhost/BGS-TODO-BACKEND/backend/users/register_user.php".
#The databases attatched contain sample data and can be restored through phpmyadmin.
#sample login test user for the frontend: 
#email: izukanjisinkolongo@gmail.com
#password: 12345678
